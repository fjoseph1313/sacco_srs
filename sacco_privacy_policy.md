## Savings and Credit Co-Operatives(SACCO): Privacy policy

Welcome to the Sacco App

This is an open source iOS & Android app developed by Francis Joseph. The source code is available on GitHub under the MIT license; the app is also available on Google Play.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously.
I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I have not programmed this app to distribute any personally identifiable information to third party or affiliate companies. All data (profile photo, Name and email]) collected are for the purpose of user management and authentication, fraud prevention and app integrity protection.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,  
Francis Joseph.  
Charlotte, North Carolina.
